              About Fixed Deposits
            </h2>

            <p>
              A Fixed Deposit (FD) is a lump-sum investment option offered by
              banks where money is deposited for a fixed tenure and earns
              interest at a predetermined rate.
            </p>

            <p>
              Interest on fixed deposits is usually compounded quarterly or
              annually, depending on the bank and payout option selected. The
              maturity amount depends on the deposit amount, tenure, interest
              rate, and compounding frequency.
            </p>

            <p>
              This FD calculator provides indicative results for planning
              purposes. Actual maturity values may differ based on bank-specific
              rules, premature withdrawal conditions, and interest rate changes.
